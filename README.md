### Challenges
While working on this project, I encountered some challenges, including:

- Deciding which data to visualize since I was not familiar with sales data prior to this project.

### Project Files
- **SQL Script**: Sales_analysis_database.sql- Contains the SQL queries used to extract and manipulate the data.
- **Power BI Report**:Sales_Analysis.pbix - Includes the visualizations and insights generated from the analysis.

### Project Details
This project involved using SQL to extract and preprocess data from the Microsoft Data Warehouse sample database and creating visualizations in Power BI to gain insights into the sales data. The project's goal was to provide a clear understanding of the data and identify key trends and patterns.

### How to Use
1. To replicate the analysis, you can use the provided SQL script to query the database for the relevant data.
2. To recreate the visualizations, open the Power BI report file and use it as a reference.
